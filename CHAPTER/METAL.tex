\chapter{Metal}
In this chapter, several frameworks suitable for developing metal models are introduced. The basic one is the von Mises framework, which is also called J2 model in some literature as it adopts the second invariant of the deviatoric stress to characterise yield function. The intermediate one is the VAFCRP model, in which a Voce type nonlinear isotropic hardening, a multiplicative Armstrong--Fredrick type kinematic hardening and a Peric type viscosity are implemented. Thus, this model can account for dynamic effects. The third model is a general framework developed based on the Hoffman criterion, it is suitable for orthotropic materials.
